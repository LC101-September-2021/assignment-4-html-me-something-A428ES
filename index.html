				My interest in coding started when I stumbled upon the view source feature of my web browser in the early 2000s. I learned HTML through this approach and freelanced coding layouts within
				graphic design communities.

				After tinkering around with some Linux distributions with what was my first computer, I ended up bricking it with no access to the internet due to an incompatibility with drivers and my hardware.
				This left me with a computer that I thought had no practical applications to me. After some exploring the OS, I found that it came with Apache Web Server, PHP and MySQL pre-installed.
				With these tools and languages, I found that my first steps into the world of programming and coding to be more engaging and mindful in creativity, as I had found the time and energy to properly learn these subjects in depth.

				I developed several websites with my newly learned skills, which mostly include websites that revolved
				around my interests. My most successful website reached an average of 2500 unique visitors a day, before selling it for far less than it was worth. I also freelanced making websites
				and managing websites for friends and acquaintances.

				My interest in operating a website declined sharply and my attention focused to writing solutions for the websites of others. At the time this was known as writing
				"scripts" for public use. I also began learning about compiler-languages such as C and C++. My most successful project was a PHP-based image hosting software that at it's height was in 
				use by 100+ different websites and had been translated for distribution in 4 different languages by the community of users.

				<img src="images/p5.png" alt="Repurposed backburner comic but instead with my programming career"  />
			
			
				After deciding to start a family and not being able to find employment in a development or programming role I started a career in sales and business development for companies
				such as AT&T, Square and Walmart Corporate. While these roles were not always technical in nature, all my previous professional roles have taught me essential skills and practices 
				that I know will compliment my technical skills in a professional development environment.

				<img src="images/p6.jpg" alt="CS50 Duck" />
			
			
				With the pandemic, my role was moved to a Work from Home basis. This resulted in changes to how I performed my work, but also how much time I had on any given day due to the
				elimination of commuting. With the increase in free time and seeing how critical websites, software and the programming process had become in the time of a crisis, I decided to 
				pursue sharpening my skills and relearning the basics. I began with the free CS50 course provided by Harvard and eDX. As I continued through the course, I became more and more committed 
				to finding employment as a programmer.

				One thing that continues being true for me is how difficult it can be to find a career in programming without a college degree, and more specifically a degree in computer science. It was 
				through trying to find support for this hurdle that I learned about LaunchCode LC101 course and the Apprenticeship program. For me, it seemed
				like the perfect opportunity to continue learning in a supported environment while taking real steps towards a career in software development.
